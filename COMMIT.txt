refactor(frontend): implement Clean Code Architecture with TanStack Query (Part 2/2)

Complete frontend refactoring with Clean Code Architecture (Components → Hooks →
Services → API). Remove Redux, add TanStack Query for server state, implement
dynamic onboarding with backend data fetching.

BREAKING CHANGES: Redux removed, auth routes moved from /login to /auth, user
profile returns full trait/category objects instead of strings.

- Remove Redux completely, replace with TanStack Query + React Context
- Add models/, services/, hooks/ infrastructure for all entities
- Refactor auth routes to /auth with dynamic trait/category fetching
- Personalize home page to show timelines for user's selected categories
- Consolidate components, remove wrappers, create base components with variants
